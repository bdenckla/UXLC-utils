<p>The MPK’s ע does not carry a dagesh for the qere’s ט, perhaps because that would be illegal.</p>
<p>Same issue, indeed same word modulo accent, six verses before, in 5:6.</p>
<p>Dotan remarks, in his Foreword to BHL (page xx):</p>
<blockquote>Another example [of a point created ex nihilo] is an ʿayin of the ketiv that cannot carry a dagesh that is due in the qere, as in the manuscript in Deut. 28:27 in the [body] text <span lang="hbo">וּבַעְפֹלִים</span> and in the margin ק̇ ובטחרים; in the printed edition a dagesh was added[, yielding] <span lang="hbo">וּבַטְּחֹרִים</span>.</blockquote>
<p>(In this quote, Dotan omits the accent (zaqef qatan) on the ל of <span lang="hbo">וּבַעְפֹלִים</span> and on the ר of <span lang="hbo">וּבַטְּחֹרִים</span>, perhaps because it is not germane to the topic at hand.)</p>
<p>Dotan’s example from dt28:27 is not a-noted in WLC, which has merely the following:</p>
