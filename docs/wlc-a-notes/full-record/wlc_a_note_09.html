<p>The MPK’s ע does not carry a dagesh for the qere’s ט, perhaps because that would be illegal.</p>
<p>Same issue, indeed same word modulo accent, six verses before, in 5:6.</p>
<p>Dotan remarks, in his Foreword to BHL (page xx):</p>
<p>Another example [of a point CEN] is an ʿayin of the ketiv that cannot carry a dagesh that is due in the qere, as in the manuscript in Deut. 28:27 in the [body] text <span lang="hbo">וּבַעְפֹלִים</span> and in the margin <span lang="hbo">ק̇ ובטחרים</span>; in the printed edition a dagesh was added[, yielding] <span lang="hbo">וּבַטְּחֹרִים</span>.</p>
<p>[The terminology CEN (created ex nihilo) is mine, not Dotan’s.]</p>
<p>[In this quote, Dotan omits the accent (zaqef qatan) on the ל of <span lang="hbo">וּבַעְפֹלִים</span> and on the ר of <span lang="hbo">וּבַטְּחֹרִים</span>, perhaps because it is not germane to the topic at hand.]</p>
<p>[Note that dt28:27 is not a-noted in WLC! (*W/B/(PLYM **W./BA/+.:XORI80YM)]</p>
