<p>UXLC rejected all rafeh-removing WLC changes.</p>
<p>In WLC 4.22, all 12 <span class="romanized">rafeh</span> marks of 4.20 were removed. Seven of those <span class="romanized">rafeh</span> marks were in the Decalogues. This is one of those seven.</p>
<p>The utility of the other five <span class="romanized">rafeh</span> marks was debatable, since they merely marked letters where <span class="romanized">dagesh/mapiq</span> might have been expected. Those <span class="romanized">rafeh</span> marks expressed something like “this letter is intentionally left blank” if “blank” is taken to mean “free of <span class="romanized">dagesh/mapiq</span>.”</p>
<p>In contrast, the utility of these seven <span class="romanized">rafeh</span> marks was less debatable. These seven marks meant something quite different than those other five. We could say that these seven <span class="romanized">rafeh</span> marks modulated the meaning of the <span class="romanized">dagesh</span> present on the same letter. These <span class="romanized">rafeh</span> marks expressed something like “the <span class="romanized">dagesh</span> below applies to only one of the cantillations.”</p>
<p>In other words, whereas the five non-Decalogue <span class="romanized">rafeh</span> marks merely reassure the reader that “this letter is intentionally left blank,” these seven <span class="romanized">rafeh</span> marks tell the reader something like “this letter is contextually left blank.”</p>
<p>As documented on page xiv of its Foreword, Dotan’s BHL does not include any <span class="romanized">rafeh</span> marks. This does not, as the WLC 4.22 documentation suggests, support the removal of these seven Decalogue <span class="romanized">rafeh</span> marks. BHL presents the Decalogues in split rather than combined form, so these <span class="romanized">rafeh</span> marks would have the usual meaning, of debatable utility, in the lower cantillation. So, the lack of <span class="romanized">rafeh</span> marks in BHL’s (four) Decalogues says nothing one way or another about the utility of <span class="romanized">rafeh</span> marks in WLC’s (two) Decalogues.</p>
<p>The WLC 4.22 documentation cites not only BHL but also BHQ in support of its decision to remove all <span class="romanized">rafeh</span> marks. The comparison with BHQ is more relevant, since BHQ, like WLC, presents the Deuteronomy Decalogue in combined rather than split form. (The Exodus fascicle of BHQ has not yet been released.)</p>
<p>Yet, I don’t consider BHQ’s lack of Decalogue <span class="romanized">rafeh</span> marks to be a precedent to be cited for support. Rather, I see BHQ’s lack of Decalogue <span class="romanized">rafeh</span> marks as yet another piece of evidence pointing to BHQ’s rather casual (or at least inconsistently serious) attitude towards details of niqqud. Here we see BHQ not only failing to improve upon BHS but in fact taking a step backwards. I advise WLC to not follow BHQ in this regression, i.e. I advise WLC to restore these 7 Decalogue <span class="romanized">rafeh</span> marks in some future version.</p>
