<p>This is part 1 of 2 of a change from k1q1×2 to k2q2. UXLC rejected this change.</p>
<p>I think I understand the impulse behind this WLC change, but nonetheless I find the change inadvisable. So I not only support UXLC’s rejection of this change but also advise WLC to revert this change in some future version.</p>
<p>My guess is that the impulse behind this change is that we are primarily dealing with a word boundary issue here. There is a <span class="romanized">ḥaser/malei</span> issue later in the second word, but the primary issue is where the word boundary falls within the letters ושוריאשכל[י]לו. Specifically, the <span class="romanized">qere</span> places the word boundary after the א, yielding</p>
<p>ושוריא שכלילו</p>
<p> whereas the <span class="romanized">ketiv</span> places the word boundary before the א, yielding</p>
<p>ושורי אשכללו</p>
<p>Because we are primarily dealing with a word boundary issue here, it is an understandable impulse to group these 4 words into a single k2q2 construct (which is what WLC 4.22 now has) rather than group them into two adjacent k1q1 constructs (which is what WLC 4.20 had). In Michigan-Clarement terms, a k2q2 construct looks something like this, schematically:</p>
<p>*ka *kb **qa **qb</p>
<p>whereas a k1q1×2 (two adjacent k1q1 constructs) looks something like this, schematically:</p>
<p>*ka **qa *kb **qb</p>
<p>Although the impulse is understandable, it is not consistent with the diplomatic spirit of WLC to allow such an impulse to override what we clearly see in the manuscript. What we clearly see in the manuscript is the choice to treat these words as k1q1×2: two adjacent k1q1 constructs. BHS and BHQ agree with the manuscript, though of course we’d be willing to reject their reading if it contradicted the manuscript.</p>
