"""Guard test: source hygiene in hand-authored source (GitHub issues #22, #26).

Run from anywhere:  python tools/source_hygiene_test.py
Prints "source_hygiene: OK" on success. On failure, raises AssertionError
listing each offender as ``path:line  U+XXXX NAME -- detail``.

Pins the live tree (must stay clean) plus synthetic positive/negative controls
for both detectors: #22's orphan-combining-mark rule and #26's
no-decomposed-composite rule. Every synthetic combining mark is built from a
``\\N{...}`` name at runtime and interpolated into a source *string* we hand to
the scanner -- it is never written as an orphan literal, so this test file
itself passes the guard.
