"""Source-hygiene guard for hand-authored source (GitHub issues #22, #26).

Enforces two rules over hand-authored ``py/`` + ``tools/`` + ``doc/``:

1. **No orphan combining mark** (#22): a string literal whose first character is
   a Unicode combining mark. Written raw, such a mark renders as an invisible or
   floating diacritic hanging off the opening quote -- unreadable in an editor,
   un-diffable in review, and easily reintroduced by hand. The fix is a named
   escape ``"\\N{UNICODE NAME}"`` (byte-identical at runtime, self-documenting,
   plain ASCII in the file).

   Why raw source, not the decoded AST value: Python decodes ``\\N{...}`` /
   ``\\uXXXX`` escapes when it builds the AST, so the *approved* escaped form and
   a *raw* orphan mark produce the identical ``ast.Constant.value``. The
   distinction survives only in the source bytes. So we locate string literals
   via the AST (precise: only real literals, never a mark inside a comment) but
   test each literal's **raw source segment** -- a leading escape ``\\`` is a
   base character and is accepted; a leading raw combining mark is flagged.

   The "first character of the literal" test is deliberate: it catches the
   floating diacritic while leaving genuine Hebrew *text* data untouched. The one
   legitimate case in the tree is a word in
   ``py/uxlc_fois/fois_mark_grammar_foi.py`` whose combining accent follows a
   ZERO WIDTH JOINER mid-string -- the literal starts with a base letter, so it
   is not flagged.

2. **No decomposed canonical composite** (#26): a base character immediately
   followed by a combining mark that together have a single-codepoint NFC
   composition (e.g. decomposed ``h`` + U+0323 -> precomposed U+1E25). Hand-
   authored source standardizes on NFC for exactly this class of character (the
   h-with-dot-below transliteration); tooling/paste-from-web defaults to NFC too,
   so pinning it removes an edit/match-failure tax rather than fighting the
   ecosystem default. Read over the *decoded* text (NFC is a property of decoded
   text, unlike rule 1's raw-source distinction). Hebrew text is never flagged:
   every Hebrew letter+point pair is on the NFC composition-exclusion list, so
   nothing Hebrew ever composes -- this holds by construction, not by
   special-casing.

Shared harness: file discovery + a pluggable tuple of ``Check``s, each yielding
``Offense(relpath, line, codepoint, uname, detail)``.

Two entry points, one scanner:
  * ``tools/source_hygiene_test.py``   -- the standalone ``*_test.py`` guard.
  * ``python tools/source_hygiene.py`` -- the CLI the pre-commit hook runs; prints
                                          each offender and exits non-zero when the
                                          tree is dirty.

Escape hatch: a trailing ``# combining-ok`` on the offending line suppresses rule
1, for the rare case where a bare combining mark is genuinely the clearest form.
