    'In WLC 4.22, all 12 rafeh marks of 4.20 were removed. '
    'Seven of those rafeh marks were in the Decalogues. '
    'This is one of those seven.',
    #
    'The utility of the other five rafeh marks was debatable, '
    'since they merely marked letters where dagesh/mapiq might have been expected. '
    'Those rafeh marks expressed something like “this letter is intentionally left blank” '
    'if “blank” is taken to mean “free of dagesh/mapiq.”',
    #
    'In contrast, the utility of these seven rafeh marks '
    'was less debatable. '
    'These seven marks meant something quite different than those other five. '
    'We could say that these seven rafeh marks modulated the meaning '
    'of the dagesh present on the same letter. '
    'These rafeh marks expressed something like '
    '“the dagesh below applies to only one of the cantillations.”',
    #
    'In other words, whereas the five non-Decalogue rafeh marks '
    'merely reassure the reader that '
    '“this letter is intentionally left blank,” '
    'these seven rafeh marks tell the reader something like '
    '“this letter is contextually left blank.”',
    #
    'As documented on page xiv of its Foreword, Dotan’s BHL does not include any rafeh marks. '
    'This does not, as the WLC 4.22 documentation suggests, support the removal '
    'of these seven Decalogue rafeh marks. '
    'BHL presents the Decalogues in split rather than combined form, '
    'so these rafeh marks would have the usual meaning, of debatable utility, '
    'in the lower cantillation. '
    'So, the lack of rafeh marks in BHL’s (four) Decalogues says nothing '
    'one way or another about the utility of rafeh marks '
    'in WLC’s (two) Decalogues.',
    #
    'The WLC 4.22 documentation cites not only BHL but also BHQ '
    'in support of its decision to remove all rafeh marks. '
    'The comparison with BHQ is more relevant, since BHQ, like WLC, '
    'presents the Deuteronomy Decalogue in combined rather than split form. '
    '(The Exodus fascicle of BHQ has not yet been released.)',
    #
    'Yet, I don’t consider BHQ’s lack of Decalogue rafeh marks '
    'to be a precedent to be cited for support. '
    'Rather, I see BHQ’s lack of Decalogue rafeh marks as '
    'yet another piece of evidence pointing to BHQ’s rather casual '
    '(or at least inconsistently serious) '
    'attitude towards details of niqqud. '
    'Here we see BHQ not only failing to improve upon BHS '
    'but in fact taking a step backwards. '
    'I advise WLC to not follow BHQ in this regression, i.e. I advise WLC '
    'to restore these 7 Decalogue rafeh marks in some future version.'

  'I think I understand the impulse behind this WLC change, '
  'but nonetheless I find the change inadvisable. '
  'So I not only support UXLC’s rejection of this change '
  'but also advise WLC to revert this change in some future version.',
  #
  'My guess is that the impulse behind this change is '
  'that we are primarily dealing with a word boundary issue here. '
  'There is a small ḥaser/malei issue late in the second word, '
  'but the primary issue is where the word boundary falls within the letters '
  'ושוריאשכל[י]לו. '
  'Specifically, the qere places the word boundary after the א, yielding',
  #
  'ושוריא שכלילו',
  #
  ' whereas the ketiv places the word boundary before the א, yielding',
  #
  'ושורי אשכללו',
  #
  'Because we are primarily dealing with a word boundary issue here, '
  'it is an understandable impulse to group these 4 words into a single k2q2 construct '
  '(which is what WLC 4.22 now has) '
  'rather than group them into two adjacent k1q1 constructs '
  '(which is what WLC 4.20 had). '
  'In Michigan-Clarement terms, a k2q2 construct looks something like this, schematically:',
  #
  '*ka *kb **qa **qb',
  #
  'whereas a k1q1×2 (two adjacent k1q1 constructs) looks something like this, schematically:',
  #
  '*ka **qa *kb **qb',
  #
  'Although the impulse is understandable, it is not consistent with the diplomatic spirit of '
  'WLC to allow such an impulse to override what we clearly see in the manuscript. '
  'What we clearly see in the manuscript is the choice to treat these words as k1q1×2: '
  'two adjacent k1q1 constructs. '
  'BHS and BHQ agree with the manuscript, though of course we’d be willing to reject their '
  'reading if it contradicted the manuscript.'
