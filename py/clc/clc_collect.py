"""Exports collect_for_book: UXLC <x> notes + their note-page prose -> ClcNotes.

This is the skeleton's note source (build-order step 3). It surfaces UXLC's own
``<x>`` self-flags but does NOT yet resolve them: the genuinely under-bar codes
m/d (a vertical bar below the letter) plus the general transcription-uncertainty
catch-all t (damaged/indistinct; any mark or letter — *not* inherently under-bar,
design doc §2, issue #18). There is no accent grammar and no charitable departure
here, so every note has ``is_uxlc_departure=False`` and ``clc_reading ==
uxlc_reading``. Charity layers on later (design doc §3, §7.1).

Each note's prose is the *actual* tanach.us note page, read offline from the
committed local copy (clc_note_pages; downloaded by main_clc_download_notes). The
build never touches the network, so its output is deterministic. There is no
fabricated substitute for a missing page (issue #19): an atom whose note page has
not been downloaded yet shows a bare ``[note not yet downloaded]`` placeholder --
never the imperative change-log description (an instruction to the editor, not a
note) and never an invented per-code gloss. clc_changes is kept only for the
atom-letter consistency guard.
