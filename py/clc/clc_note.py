"""Exports ClcNote, the single note schema all CLC note sources flow into.

The skeleton only sources UXLC's own ``<x>`` self-flags (the under-bar codes m/d
plus the general transcription-uncertainty catch-all t — see design doc §2, issue
#18), but the schema is deliberately source-agnostic: bracket notes, change
records, FOIs,
dagesh restorations, etc. all feed this same record (design doc §8, "one
renderer, many sources"). Records are plain data (JSON-serializable) so the same
notes can later drive the §7.9 differences-from-UXLC index.
