"""Exports note-page prose: the *actual* tanach.us note, read from a local copy.

UXLC's ``<x>`` code points at a per-(atom, code) note page on tanach.us, e.g.
``https://tanach.us/Notes/Proverbs/Proverbs.5.19.4-m.html``. Its reader-facing
*note* prose is the manuscript note we want to render, plus (issue #30) the
page's own ``<h2>`` change-summary line, included verbatim as the note's opening
sentence -- however imperative-sounding, it is real content of this same
downloaded page, same trust boundary as the ``<p>`` prose. This is unrelated to
the *separately-ingested* local UXLC changes XML (``in/UXLC-misc/*.xml``, parsed
by ``py/uxlc_changes/``), whose ``<correction><description>`` is an imperative
instruction to the editor and is never used as note prose (issue #19) -- it
survives only as the atom-letter consistency guard
(``clc_collect._check_atom_consistency``).

To keep the CLC build deterministic and offline, those pages are downloaded as a
separate, non-default step (``main_clc_download_notes``) into committed files
under ``in/UXLC-notes/``; this module only *reads* that local copy and extracts
its prose. No network here -- a page missing locally just returns ``None``.

Two page formats are in the wild and must both be handled:

  * NoteMaker-generated (newer): prose is the ``<h2>`` change-summary line
    followed by body-level ``<p>`` paragraphs; the author is
    ``<p><b><i>...</i></b></p>`` and the change link a
    ``<p align="right"><b><a>...</a></b></p>``.

  * Hand-authored (older, ~2021): the note's lead line is an ``<h4>`` and the rest
    of the prose is *bare* body text split by self-closing ``<p/>`` separators (no
    ``<p>...</p>`` wrappers at all); the author is a bare ``<b><i>...</i></b>``.

Both formats share the same noise, so one rule covers them: the prose is the body
text that is NOT inside a ``<table>`` (image credit / note index), NOT inside the
``<h1>`` citation, and NOT inside inline markup (``<b>``/``<i>``/``<a>``, which
wrap the author and the change link). Everything else in the body -- ``<h2>``
text, ``<p>`` text, ``<h4>`` text, and bare text -- is note prose.
