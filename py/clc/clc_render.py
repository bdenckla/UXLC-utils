"""Exports write_book: render a CLC book as a 3-column always-link page.

Layout (design doc §7.3, build-order step 4): one row per verse, columns
``text | ref | doc``. The verse-number (ref) is a narrow central spine with the
Hebrew text on its left and the doc apparatus on its right; keeping the text
adjacent to the ref means a short verse stays butted against its label (no need
for zebra shading to tie the two together). The text column is running verse
text; every noted word is an always-link (no MAM short-inline / long-link
threshold) to its note in the doc column of the same row. CLC defines its own
``clc-*`` CSS vocabulary parallel
to MAM's ``mam-doc-*`` (design doc §8); the rules live in gh-pages/style.css.

    # maqqef to an *initially-stressed* following word — may or may not cover Deut 5:7 (יהיה־לך).
    # Do NOT adjudicate it: an earlier draft claimed לך is "final-stressed, not initial," so the

    # shewa forming no syllable of its own would make לְךָ pattern with his monosyllables). Per
    # Ben, we do NOT litigate that in the note. Either way CLC's move stands: a gaʿya is metrical
    # (not an accent), "as a rule" is not "always," and — decisively — the one mark the LC

    # one. The rendered note keeps none of this argument in prose: it is just a one-sentence
