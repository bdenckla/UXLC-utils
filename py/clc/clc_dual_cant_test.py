"""Self-contained test for clc_dual_cant (the first CLC test module).

Run from anywhere:  python py/clc/clc_dual_cant_test.py
Prints "clc_dual_cant: OK" on success; raises AssertionError on failure.

It reads Genesis 35:22 straight from the UXLC XML (paths derived from __file__,
so it is independent of cwd and of the my_uxlc reader), then checks the split is
**near-subtractive with two narrow charities**: each strand is the combined text
with only the *other* strand's divergence cluster resolved — position-safely, so
a mark that recurs elsewhere as a shared mark is never touched — plus, for the
alef strand, a *supplied* sof-pasuq held in ``atom["additions"]`` (bracketed/green
in the render), never folded into the strand text. Synthetic ``split_word`` cases
pin the position-safety for QUPO (two vowels) and rafe+dagesh divergences; the
QUPO case is also now proven on real data (ex 20:3 / dt 5:7's atom 7 פני, the only
QUPO-vowel Decalogue verses — see ``test_decalogue_qupo_vowel_split``).
