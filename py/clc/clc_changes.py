"""Exports load_descriptions: index each noted atom's recorded letters by citation.

UXLC's ``<x>`` element carries only a one-letter code; the change that added the
note records the word it applied to. clc_collect joins notes onto atoms by the
integer ``position`` (1-based atom index within the verse, counting <w>/<q>/<k>),
but that key is fragile: if atoms are ever merged or split, positions shift and
the join would silently land on the wrong atom. So we index, per citation, the
letter-only form of each change's word, which clc_collect asserts the current
atom against (_check_atom_consistency). A collision needs *both* the position and
the letter-string to match the wrong atom -- vanishingly unlikely outside an
immediately-repeated identical word.

The citation key is ``(book_id, chnu, vrnu, position)``, matching UXLC's own
change-citation positions and the atom enumeration in clc_read.

(The note *prose* shown to readers comes from the downloaded tanach.us note page,
not from here -- see clc_note_pages.)
