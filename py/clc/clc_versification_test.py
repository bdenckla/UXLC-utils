"""Self-contained test for clc_versification (the §7.8 vtrad-MAM Decalogue verse map).

Run from anywhere:  python py/clc/clc_versification_test.py
Prints "clc_versification: OK" on success; raises AssertionError on failure.

Two things are checked:

  * the hand-encoded BHS↔MAM map (``clc_to_mam`` / ``mam_merge_group`` / boundaries) on
    the known Decalogue anchors and its structural invariants (monotonic, identity outside
    the two chapters); and
  * the **validation** that gives #45 its content: the boundaries MAM reads through (this
    module's merge groups) coincide **1:1** with the atoms where the §7.7 ``_ORACLE`` shows
    the elyon strand ending a verse the taḥton strand reads through — i.e. MAM's
    versification *is* the taḥton strand, so §7.7 already renders the overlay.

The full 53-verse agreement with MAM-basics' own converter was established once against a
``.novc/`` versemap dump (produced by a throwaway harvest script, since retired); that dump is
gitignored, so this test pins the map by hardcoded known facts instead of reading it.
