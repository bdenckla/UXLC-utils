"""Exports the UXLC attribution citations CLC must carry to use UXLC's notes.

The UXLC author licenses the detailed notes on condition that (1) each note cites
the UXLC and its version number ("UXLC 2.5") and (2) UXLC is cited as the base of
the Hebrew biblical text. This is the single source of truth for that wording and
version, so nothing is duplicated:

  * top_credit()  -> the page-level credit: cites UXLC as the base of the Hebrew
                     text (condition 2) and acknowledges the notes as copyrighted,
                     used by permission
  * note_cite()   -> the short per-note cite appended to each note (condition 1)

The version is read once from the core-XML header (uxlc_version), never hardcoded,
so the citations auto-update if UXLC bumps to 2.6.
