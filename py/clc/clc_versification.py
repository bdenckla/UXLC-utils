"""CLC(vtrad-BHS) <-> MAM(vtrad-MAM) Decalogue verse map (design doc §7.8).

CLC's primary versification is **vtrad-BHS**. §7.8 optionally surfaces where MAM's
versification (vtrad-MAM) differs. In the whole Bible that difference is confined to the
two Decalogue passages (Exodus 20, Deuteronomy 5); everywhere else MAM and BHS number
verses identically, so this module is identity outside those two chapters.

**What MAM's Decalogue numbering is (verified, not assumed).** MAM's merged-elyon verse
numbering — the numbering MAM-with-doc's HTML anchors use (``#c{ch}v{v}``) — coincides
**exactly with the taḥton (alef) strand's verse boundaries** of the §7.7 split, NOT the
elyon strand's. BHS (CLC's primary) is the *finer* division: it places a verse boundary
wherever *either* strand ends, so BHS = taḥton-boundaries ∪ elyon-boundaries. MAM keeps
only the taḥton boundaries, so relative to BHS it *merges* exactly the runs the elyon
strand chants as one verse while taḥton reads through:

    early split (elyon reads each of "I am" / "no other gods" as one commandment-verse):
        MAM Ex 20:2  = BHS Ex 20:2 + 20:3
        MAM Dt  5:6  = BHS Dt  5:6 + 5:7
    late split (elyon reads each short commandment — murder/adultery/steal/false-witness —
        as its own verse; taḥton and MAM run them together):
        MAM Ex 20:12 = BHS Ex 20:13 + 20:14 + 20:15 + 20:16
        MAM Dt  5:16 = BHS Dt  5:17 + 5:18 + 5:19 + 5:20

The BHS-only "late" 4-way splits are absent from Sefaria's numbering; the early splits are
shared with Sefaria. This module maps BHS↔MAM only (the §7.8 overlay); the Sefaria contrast
lives in ``.novc/mam_decalogue_versemap.json``'s ``mam_to_sef`` block if ever wanted.

**Where §7.8 is rendered: it already is, by §7.7.** Because MAM's versification *is* the
taḥton strand, and §7.7 renders both strands side by side for every diverging Decalogue
verse, the vtrad-MAM boundary overlay is already visible — every place MAM merges is an
atom where §7.7 shows the elyon strand ending a verse (silluq + sof-pasuq) that the taḥton
strand (= MAM) reads through. So #45 adds **no new rendered surface** (Ben's call): §7.8 is
**validation-only**, the same shape as the MAM cross-checks of §7.7 (issues #42/#43/#44).
``clc_versification_test`` asserts the two accounts agree 1:1 (the taḥton reads-through
points from this module's merge groups == the elyon-ends atoms of ``clc_dual_cant._ORACLE``).

**Source-path (why hand-encoded).** The authoritative converter lives in MAM-basics'
``py_misc.vtrad_data`` / ``versification_differences`` — a **non-``mb_`` dir**, so neither
importable nor vendorable into official CLC code (only ``mb_*`` dirs are; see the repo
CLAUDE.md). A throwaway harvest script (since retired) reached into it to emit a ``.novc/``
versemap dump; the tiny result (four merge groups) is **hand-encoded here once**, validated
against that dump, with **nothing of MAM-basics imported at runtime**
— the same "MAM consulted as signal, embedded nowhere" discipline as §7.7's ``_ORACLE`` and
the Unit A/B cross-checks. Moving the general converter upstream into an ``mb_*`` entry point
was the alternative; not worth it for four facts fully known here.

**Reuse.** The ``clc_to_mam`` map is the CLC-verse → MAM-verse helper issue #38 also needs
(to link a CLC verse to its MAM-with-doc doc-note anchor) — built once here, not a #45-only
hack.
