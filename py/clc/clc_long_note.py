"""Exports write_page: one "long notes" apparatus page per main page (design doc §7.3).

Design doc §7.3 sketches an "intended" MAM-with-doc-style split: short notes inline
in the doc column, long ones relegated to a separate page. MAM-with-doc decides that
split automatically, by a length threshold (> 400 rendered chars). CLC deliberately
does NOT reuse that threshold: an editor opts a specific note in by hand (clc_render's
``_LONG_NOTE_SPECS``), so this module never inspects note length or decides anything
itself -- it only lays out whatever entries it is handed.

Each main page (one per main_clc.py build job, i.e. one per ``clc_render.out_label``)
gets its own long-notes page, so it has exactly one main page to link back to -- unlike
MAM's per-book "big-doc" pages, this is one-per-job rather than one-per-book, matching
write_book's own chapter-limited granularity. A job with no long notes gets no page at
all (write_page returns None). Each entry keeps its own anchor so a short inline note
can link straight to its expanded body.
