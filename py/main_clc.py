"""Exports main: build the CLC walking skeleton for one pilot book, or all of them.

Usage (run from the repo root, like the other py/main_*.py drivers):

    python py/main_clc.py                      # default: all pilot pages (_ALL_JOBS)
    python py/main_clc.py all                   # same, explicit
    python py/main_clc.py [BookId] [chapter]     # just one page

Pass any bk39 id (e.g. "Psalms", "Job", "Genesis") to retarget. Pass an
optional 1-based chapter number to limit output to that chapter (e.g.
``python py/main_clc.py Exodus 20`` for the Decalogue) — handy for focusing on a
dual-cant chapter without the rest of the book.

Writes (``<label>`` is ``<book>`` for a whole book, ``<book>-<chapter>`` if limited):
    gh-pages/clc/<label>.html             the 3-column always-link page
    gh-pages/clc/<label>-notes.json       the CLC notes as plain data (feeds §7.9 later)
    gh-pages/clc/<label>-long-notes.html  this job's long notes (§7.3), only if it has any
