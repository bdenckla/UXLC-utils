Consider changing the patah on he to qamats. Retain the patah and add note 't'.
The patah on the he was a result of a change in change file 2021.04.01 - Changes at 2021.02.22 - 12 from the original condition in which the previous vowel was a qamats. The dot of the putative qamats is reddish and slightly oversized. The text in this region does not have many extraneous dots, however. Examining the qamats on the adjacent lines shows that the dot of the putative qamats is spaced at a greater distance from the bar of the qamats than in the adjacent lines. This is particularly true of the qamats preceding/following the putative qamats. Dotan in BHLA also sees the vowel as a qamats, but has a patah in his body text, BHL. Ben Denckla argues convincingly that Dotan did not have access to color images of the text. Retain the patah as the vowel on the he and add a transcription note 't'.
