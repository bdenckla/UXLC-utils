* Remove dagesh from last vav; place a qubuts under next-to-last vav in qere word. Add note 't'.
The qere letters in the right margin, וישתחוו, end in two vavs, whereas the (ketiv) body text shown in the image ends in a single vav. A problem arises as to how to distribute the 2 vowel/accent markings (qubuts, mahapakh) shown on the (ketiv) body text vav among the two vavs of the qere. The conventional assignment is to place the mahapakh on the next-to-last vav and place a dagesh (acting as a shuruq dot) on the final vav. (וְיִֽשְׁתַּחֲו֤וּ as in the reference text and the BHL body text). This replaces the qubuts with a dagesh acting as a shuruq dot on the final vav. The UXLC retains the qubuts on the next-to-last vav to be true to the LC image. A transcription note 't' is added to emphasize this decision.
BHL has qere has a mahapakh on the next-to-last vav and a dagesh on the last vav. BHLA has no entry for this word but has an entry for word 10; the entry for word 10 agrees with the UXLC text.
* Remove dagesh in last vav; place a qubuts on next-to-last vav in qere word. Add note 't'.
The qere letters in the left margin, וישתחוו, end in two vavs, whereas the (ketiv) body text shown in the image ends in a single vav. A problem arises as to how to distribute the 3 vowel/accent markings (dagesh, qubuts, meteg) shown on the (ketiv) body text vav among the two vavs of the qere. The conventional assignment is to place a dagesh on each of the last two vavs, leaving the meteg on the next-to-last vav (וַיִּֽשְׁתַּחֲוּֽוּ׃ as in the reference text and the BHLA qere). This replaces the qubuts with a dagesh acting as a shuruq dot. The same word appears as an ordinary word with a merkha accent in Gen 27:29.10. The UXLC places the qubuts on the next-to-last vav to be true to the LC image. A transcription note 't' is added to emphasize this decision.
BHL has qere has no dagesh on the next-to-last vav and a dagesh in the last vav; the meteg is on the next-to-last vav. BHLA agrees with the markings on the marked ketiv above, but has a dagesh on the last two vavs with the meteg on the next-to-last vav.
Remove unsupported maqaf at end of word.
The image shows words 5 and 6 of this verse. The qere letters for this word (מה) and its successor (זה) appear on separate lines in the left margin; no maqaf appears these letters. No maqaf is apparent in the ketiv letters (מזה) of the body text shown in the image. The letter he of this word is not in the ketiv letters but is taken from the qere letters for this word.
BHL has a maqaf at the end of this word. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Remove dagesh from qere bet.
The qere letters in the right margin (בעבר) replace the mem of the ketiv body text with a bet. The mem does not contain a dagesh in the body text; thus, the bet should not contain a dagesh. This action is the reverse of that on the following Josh 24:15.21.
BHL has a dagesh in the bet. BHLA has no dagesh in the bet of this word.
Add dagesh to qere mem.
The bet of the ketiv body text contain a clear dagesh. Therefore the mem, which replaces the bet in the qere, must have a dagesh. This action is the reverse of that of the preceding Josh 22:7.13.
BHL has no dagesh in the qere. BHLA has a dagesh in the mem.
Remove unsupported dagesh from bet in qere-without-ketiv word.
The image shows UXLC words 14 and 16; the word in question is a qere without ketiv word that has no letters in the ketiv body text. The bet with a dagesh in the image belongs to the following word, not the word in question. The qere letters, בני, are visible in the right margin along with a clear "qere without ketiv" Masoretic note. Three markings for this word (sheva, tsere, munah) are evident under the vav of the previous word, אָבוּ֙. A problem arises with the dagesh in the vav of the previous word: could it belong to the bet of this word instead? The transcription leaves the dagesh in the preceding word and transcribes the bet in this word without a dagesh.
BHL has a dagesh in the qere bet, the other markings (sheva, tsere, munah) agree with the reference text. BHLA has no entry for this word; it has an entry for the following word, בִּנְיָמִ֔ן for this verse.
* Replace dagesh in next-to-last vav with qubuts. Add note 't'.
The qere letters in the right margin have two vavs at the end of this word. Ketiv body text in the image has a dagesh (acting as a shuruq dot) and a qubuts on its single vav. The transcription places the qubuts marking under the next-to-last vav and retains the dagesh in the last vav. A transcription note 't' is added.
BHL has qere has a dash in the next-to-last and final vavs. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Remove unsupported dagesh from tet in qere.
The ketiv word is בעפלים (hemorrhoids), whereas the qere word is בַּטְּחֹרִ֔ים (tumors). They have the same number of letters; thus the markings on the ketiv letters are directly transposable to the qere letters. The ketiv letter ayin in the body text ketiv tet has no dagesh. This is similar to the following change, 1 Sam 5:12.7, except for the accent on the qere resh. This action is explained in Dotan's BHL page xx for Deut 28:27.6: The ketiv ayin can not take a dagesh, thus the writer didn't place a dagesh there. Nevertheless, no dagesh appears in the LC to justify a dagesh in the tet.
BHL has a dagesh in the tet for the qere. BHLA has an entry only for word 6 of this verse (the reference text for word 6 agrees with BHLA).
Remove unsupported dagesh from tet in qere.
The ketiv word is בעפלים (hemorrhoids), whereas the qere word is בַּטְּחֹרִ֔ים (tumors). They have the same number of letters; thus the markings on the ketiv letters are directly transposable to the qere letters. The ketiv letter ayin in the body text ketiv tet has no dagesh. This is similar to the preceding change, 1 Sam 5:6.10, except for the accent on the qere resh. This action is explained in Dotan's BHL page xx for Deut 28:27.6: The ketiv ayin can not take a dagesh, thus the writer didn't place a dagesh there. Nevertheless, no dagesh appears in the LC to justify a dagesh in the tet.
BHL has a dagesh in the tet for the qere. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Remove sheva from under first nun. Add note 't'. [Repeat]
This word was studied in Change file 2024.04.01; Change 2024.01.14 - 1; it is repeated here for completeness. The image is the LC body text which consists of the ketiv consonants, מבן־ימין (2 words), with the qere pointing. The qere consonants, מבנימין, appear to the right of the column and have no space or maqaf. The first nun is in the qere is a nun (נ); a not a final nun (ן). Words 3, 4, 5 of the UXLC represent both the LC body text and the qere consonants; words 3, 4 contain the ketiv variants for this image; UXLC word 5 is the qere variant, shown in the Reference/Change above. No sheva is present under the first nun in the image; hence, the qere has no sheva under the nun. The usual spelling of Benjamin, בִנְיָמִן, is with a sheva under the first nun. A transcription note 't' will be added.
BHL has a maqaf after the first nun (ן) in the ketiv; it has no maqaf and sheva on the first nun (נ) in the qere. BHLA has a maqaf after the first nun (ן) in the ketiv; it has no maqaf and no sheva on the first nun (נ) in the qere. Both BHL and BHLA effectively consider the final nun (ן) and maqaf in the LC body text to be part of the ketiv. (The UXLC agrees with BHLA.) Not re-entered in BHL statistics.
* Replace dagesh in final vav with qubuts under resh in qere word. Add note 't'.
The qere letters in the right margin have a terminal vav that is not present in the ketiv letters of the body text. A qubuts vowel occurs before the munah under the resh. The conventional assignment is to place the munah on the resh and to place a dagesh (acting as a shuruq dot) on the final vav. (וַיֹּאמְר֣וּ as in the reference text and the BHL body text). This replaces the qubuts with a dagesh acting as a shuruq dot on the final vav. The UXLC retains the qubuts on the next-to-last vav to be true to the LC image. A transcription note 't' is added to emphasize this decision. This change is similar to that of 1 Sam 13:19.9.
BHL has a dagesh in the final vav of the qere. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
* Replace dagesh in final vav with qubuts under resh in qere word. Add note 't'.
The qere letters in the right margin have a terminal vav that is not present in the ketiv letters of the body text. A qubuts vowel occurs before the munah under the resh. The conventional assignment is to place the munah on the resh and to place a dagesh (acting as a shuruq dot) on the final vav. (וַיֹּאמְר֣וּ as in the reference text and the BHL body text). This replaces the qubuts with a dagesh acting as a shuruq dot on the final vav. The UXLC retains the qubuts on the next-to-last vav to be true to the LC image. A transcription note 't' is added to emphasize this decision. This change is similar to that of 1 Sam 12.10.5.
BHL has a dagesh in the final vav of the qere. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Examine qere word.
The qere letters shown in the left margin, ממערכות, contain a kaf between the resh and the vav that is not present in the ketiv letters of the body text, ממערות. The ketiv letter resh has both a sheva then munah. The usual transcription is to place the sheva on the resh and the munah on the kaf. A transcription note 't' is added.
BHL has the munah on the vav in the ketiv and a sheva on the resh the munah on the kaf in the qere. BHLA has a sheva then munah on the ketiv resh and transcribes the sheva to the resh and the munah to the kaf in the qere. The difference between BHL and BHLA is on the ketiv words, not the qere words. Thus, the UXLC reference text agrees with both the BHL and BHLA; this changed is marked as agreeing with the BHL.
Remove unsupported dagesh from second vav in qere word.
The qetiv letters in the left margin, ויולדו, have a vav after the yod; this vav is not on the ketiv letters, וילדו, of the body text. The body text shown in the image has a dagesh and a hiriq on the yod with a qamats between the yod and the lamed's sheva. Transcription of the qamats to below the second vav is reasonable; however, no support is evident for a dagesh in the second vav. (The writer could have added a qubuts near the qamats if a dagesh been intended on the second vav.)
BHL has a dagesh and qamats in the yod. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Remove unsupported dagesh from pe in qere without ketiv word.
The image above shows the preceding ordinary word; the word in question is a qere without ketiv word whose letters do not appear in the LC body text. The marginal note has the 3 letters, פרת, and says that this is a qere without ketiv word. The body text has the markings sheva, qamats, meteg that must be applied to the 3 letters. Nothing in the image suggests a dagesh in the pe.
BHL has a dagesh and sheva on the pe and a qamats then meteg on the resh in the qere. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Remove maqaf from qere word. [Repeat]
This change was considered in changes file 2024.04.01:2024.01.18 - 2; it is repeated here for completeness. This word is the first qere component of a two word qere, עַל־כֵּ֥ן. The two qere words are part of qere-without-ketiv variant, where the second qere word, כֵּ֥ן, has no matching ketiv word. The tsere, merkha pointings under the lamed belong to the second qere whose letters, כן, are shown in the left margin along with the Masoretic note: qere and no ketiv.
BHL has a maqaf at the end of this word. BHLA has no maqaf at the end of this word. (The UXLC agrees with BHLA.) Not re-entered in BHL statistics.
Remove unsupported dagesh from bet in qere word.
The qere ltters for this word, בתחלת, are given in the right margin. The ketiv body text letters lack the initial bet. The ketev body text has a hiriq preceding the ketiv initial tav. This hiriq clearly belongs to the qere bet. The body text does not support the transcription of a dagesh for the bet, however. A transcription note 't' will be added.
BHL has a dagesh in the bet of the qere. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Remove unsupported dagesh from yod in qere word.
The qere letters, ויתגעש, are given in the right margin and have a yod between the vav and the tav. The hiriq appearing after the patah in the ketiv body text is clearly intended for the qere yod. No support for a dagesh on the yod is apparent.
BHL has a dagesh in the yod of the qere. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Remove unsupported dagesh from lamed in qere word.
The qere letters, האלה, in the right margin have the order of the lamed and final he reversed relative to those, האהל, of the ketiv body text. Most of the markings on the ketiv body text are easily applied to the qere letters. The body text does not support a dagesh in the lamed, however. This action may be explained in Dotan's BHL page xx for Deut 28:27.6: The ketiv he can not take a dagesh, thus the writer didn't place a dagesh there. Nevertheless, no dagesh appears in the LC to justify a dagesh in the lamed.
BHL has a dagesh in the lamed of the qere. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Examine qere word.
The qere letters, וישתחוו, are shown in the left margin and end in 2 vavs, whereas the ketiv body text ends in a single vav, וישתחו. The merkha in the ketiv body text is between the het and the vav and can be attributed to the next-to-last vav.
BHL has a merkha under the next-to-last vav and a dagesh (acting as a shuruq dot) on the final vav in the qere. BHLA has an entry for this verse for word 20, but not for this word..
* Replace dagesh on final vav with qubuts under resh in qere word. Add note 't'.
The qere letters, וידברו, in the right margin end in a vav, the final vav is not present in the ketiv body text letters. A qubuts mark is shown under the resh in the image. It will replace the dagesh (acting as a shuruq dot) on the final vav.
BHL has a dagesh (acting as a shuruq dot) on the final vav in the qere. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Remove unsupported sheva from final kaf. Add note 't'.
The qere in the left margin is שכניך; the ketiv body text, שכנכי. That is, the two qere/ketiv letters yod and kaf are interchanged. Thus the marking under the ketiv kaf is intended for the qere yod; no marking is present under the ketiv yod; thus a sheva should not be added to the qere final kaf.
BHL has a hiriq on the yod and a sheva on the final kaf in the qere. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Remove unsupported dagesh from dalet. Add note 't'.
The qere in the right margin, דביונים, differs in two letters from the ketiv body text, חרייונים. The initial letter is a het and the yod is doubled in the ketiv. The qere has a dalet as the initial letter and a single yod. The het in the ketiv body text lacks a dagesh but has a hiriq. Thus, a dagesh on the qere dalet is unsupported. Dotan's assertion (pg. xx) that the writer will not place a dagesh in a letter not taking a dagesh, even in the ketiv form, may be in action here. The holam is over the 4-th letter in the ketiv body text; thus it belongs to the 4-th letter of the qere, a vav.
BHL has a dagesh in the dalet and a holam on the vav in the qere. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Examine qere without ketiv word.
The image shows words 9 and 11 of the UXLC text. Word 10 is marked as a qere without ketiv in the right margin and given as צבאות. The markings sheva, qamats, tipeha, are clearly seen between the two words in the image. These markings are intended for the qere.
BHL agrees with the reference text in the qere. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Remove unsupported dagesh from bet in qere without ketiv word. Add note 't'.
The image shows words 8 and 10 of the UXLC text. Word 9 is marked as a qere without ketiv in the right margin and given as בניו. The markings qamats, qamats, pashta, are seen between the two words in the image. These markings are intended for the qere. No dagesh is indicated for the bet. It will be removed and a transcription note added,
BHL has a dagesh in the bet in the qere word. BHL doesn't show a dagesh in its ketive body text markings. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
* Replace dagesh in vav with a qubuts under het in qere word. Add note't'.
The qere word, יקחו, in the right margin, ends in a vav. This vav is not present in the ketiv body text, יקח. A qubuts vowel is present under the he. A small dagesh for the qof is in the upper part of the qof loop.
BHL has a dagesh in the qof and has a dagesh (acting as a shuruq dot) in the vav. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Add dagesh to first mem.
The qere text, ממלך, in left margin, has an initial mem; the ketiv body text, במלך, has an initial bet. The image has a dagesh in both the initial bet and the following mem. A dagesh will be added to the initial mem .
BHL has no dagesh in the initial mem in the qere; otherwise, it agrees with the reference text. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
