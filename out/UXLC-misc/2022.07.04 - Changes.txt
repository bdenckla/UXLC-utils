The two Egyptian names פוטיפר and פוטיפרע are similar, but have different word divisions based on their accents and Masorah Parva (Mp) notes in the margins.
The following translations are from The Contemporary Torah, JPS, 2006, available as the English translation at the "Sefaria: Miqra according to the Masorah" link. פוטיפר is written Potiphar, and described as "a courtier of Pharaoh and his prefect." Potiphar occurs twice: Gen 37:36.6 and 39:1.5. פוטיפרע is written Poti-phera and described as "priest of On". Poti-phera occurs 3 times: Gen 41:45.12, 41:50.14, and 46:20.10.
The LC text displays both פוטיפר and פוטיפרע without spacing indicating word divisions. However, both the accents and the Mp notes indicate that פוטיפרע, Poti-phera, should be considered as two words: פוטי פרע. When the LC text displays the 2 Potiphar cases פוטיפר has a single primary accent; when the LC text displays the three Poti-phera cases both פוטי and פרע have a single primary accent. Breuer suggests that the primary accents are the masorete's way to indicate separate words within the text (since it would have been very difficult for the masorete to insert a space between them after the consonants were written). Gen 41:45 and 41:50 are also accompanied by Mp notes תרתין מילין כתׄ ("Written as two words"). The Poti-phera case in Gen 46:20.10 does not have a similar Mp note, but has primary accents on both פוטי and פרע.
The UXLC follows the accents and Mp notes; it represents all 3 Poti-phera cases as word pairs.
The split into two words is correct; add note 'c'.
