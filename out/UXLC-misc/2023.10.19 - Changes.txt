The masorah circle refers to the note ל' which says that אברה appears only once in the Bible (which is correct). The masorah circle may appear "malformed" precisely because the small dot for revia ( ◌֗ ) has collided with it.

A small, light, but well-positioned dagesh appears in the lamed. Add note 't'.

Examine all dageshes on this word. Add note 't'.
The text quality is poor and many dots might be considered as dageshes. The dagesh on the nun is light, but well-positioned and is the best candidate. The dagesh on the first vav is dark, but attached to the gimel. A potential dagesh/shuruq appears on the second vav, however, it is blurred and very light; whereas the holam is clear. A light dot even appears after the tav!
A dagesh in an initial nun is unexpected in normal Hebrew grammar; however, this particular dagesh in the nun is found in many Masoretic texts. Ben Denckla has found 115 instances of a dagesh in an initial nun in the UXLC. It is a special Masoretic form called a "דגש לתפארת הקריאה", or "accentual dagesh" (Reuben Alcalay Hebrew/English dictionary) meaning "elegant pronunciation". Thanks to Ben Denckla and Seth (Avi) Kadish for their comments on this dagesh.
Note: this verse has 4 words (of 16) marked with Masorah circles (not shown in the UXLC). They appear on words 3, 9, 12, and 13 (this word); all 4 of the Masoretic marginal notes indicate that these words are unique in the Tanach. This is confirmed by a consonants-only search of the UXLC text for each word.
BHL agrees with the existing UXLC text. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Remove dagesh from qof.
The dot in the qof is well-positioned but small, reddish, and very light. The dot in the final mem is ill-positioned, small, reddish, and very light. Other dots in this word are dark.
BHL has no dagesh in the qof. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Change revia above alef to zaqef qatan.
The text is on the last line of column 2 and is poorly written. A zaqef qatan with the lower dot touching the alef is apparent. The dot near the top of the shown photo is from a qamats on the previous line.
BHL has a zaqef qatan over the alef. BHLA has no entry for this verse.

Examine segol under the shin as a possible qamats. Add note 't'.

BHL has a segol under the shin. BHLA has a qamats under the shin with a '?' in parentheses.
Change segol under shin to sheva. Examine possible dagesh in he.

Consider merkha under zayin as possible tevir. Add note 't'.

Remove dagesh from yod.
No dagesh appears in the yod.
BHL has no dagesh in the yod. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Consider the near-vertical mark below the ayin. Add note 't'.
The near-vertical mark is likely to have been intended as a meteg rather than a merkha because the poetic word, עַֽל־כֵּ֛ן , already has a tevir on it. The near-vertical mark is positioned below the patah. The meteg will be positioned after the patah and a note 't' added.
BHL has a meteg after a patah on the ayin; however, the BHL always positions metegs after the vowel as an editorial practice, so the BHL is not determinative of position in this case. BHLA has no entry for this verse.

Add dagesh to resh.
