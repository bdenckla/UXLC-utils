Note possible dagesh in the first nun and weak dot in tsere under the tav. Add note 't'.
The text is in good condition near this word. A reddish blob appears in nun; it is poorly formed and ill-positioned, compared to the dagesh in the tav. The blob will not be transcribed as a dagesh. The leading dot in the tsere under the tav is reddish and small but well-formed and well positioned. It will remain a tsere.
BHL has no dagesh in the nun and a tsere under the tav. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Remove meteg under dalet and remove dagesh from yod.
Neither a meteg under the dalet nor a dagesh in the yod are apparent in the LC. Ben Denckla: "... though the tsere and tipeḥa are displaced very "late," we still transcribe them as belonging to the yod, not the alef. They are "late" probably not only because of the inherent narrowness of the yod, but also because we see the somewhat-common "yod nested in nun" construct here".
BHL has no meteg under the dalet; it does have a dagesh in the yod. BHLA has no meteg under the dalet and no dagesh in the yod.
Change merkha to meteg under dalet. Ignore possible dagesh.
This is the second of 3 די in this verse, not counting the initial ודי. A reddish, small, but well-positioned dot appears in the dalet. Because the dalet has a clear rafe mark on the dalet no dagesh will be transcribed. No maqaf appears on this word in the LC.
BHL has a meteg after a hiriq on the dalet and the word ends with a maqaf. No dagesh appears in the dalet. BHLA has meteg after a hiriq in the dalet without a dagesh in the dalet and without a final maqaf.
Segol under the dalet has a weak lower dot. Add a note 't'.
The dot below the tsere is reddish and light; however, it is well-sized and well-positioned. The text does not have many extraneous dots near this word. The vowel will continue as segol.
BHL has a tsere under the dalet. BHLA has a segol under the dalet with a '?' in parentheses.
Add dagesh to he.
The he has a smudge in its trailing leg. In that smudge is a dot in contact with the interior of the leg that is well-sized and distinct. It will be transcribed as a dagesh.
BHL has a dagesh in the he. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Add dagesh to tet.

Examine vowel under yod as possible tsere, rather than segol.
Although irregular and smeared, the mark under the two dots of the putative tsere is dark and well-positioned.
BHL has a tsere under the yod. BHLA has a segol under the yod.
Examine possible vav following mem.
The trailing lower vertical component of the mem is split. This is likely due to ink fracturing and removal than an intentional added vav.
BHL has no vav after the mem. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Ambiguous vowel under the bet. Add note 't'.
The text quality is poor. The vowel under the bet is ambiguous and might be a qamats.
BHL has a patah under the bet. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Remove dagesh from he.
The text quality is poor; however, no plausible dagesh is evident in the he.
BHL has a dagesh in the he. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Examine accent over bet. Add note 't'.
The text is of poor quality. The upper dot of the current zaqef-qatan is weak, but well-positioned. The lower dot is low for a revia.
BHL has a zaqef-qatan over the bet. BHLA has no entry for this word in this verse.
Remove maqaf from end of word.
No maqaf is evident in the LC.

This word is the first of two instances of האיל in the verse. The upper dot of the putative sheva is reddish, but well-sized and well-positioned.
BHL has a hiriq under the yod. BHLA has a sheva under the yod.
Change zaqef-qatan to revia over alef.
This word is the second of two instances of האיל in the verse. Evidence of erasure appears over the revia, suggesting it was originally a zaqef-qatan.
BHL has a revia over the alef. BHLA has an entry for the first instance of האיל in this verse.
Remove maqaf from end of word.
No maqaf is evident at the end of this word. An odd circle does appear under/in the lamed, however.
BHL has no maqaf at the end of this word. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Examine possible dagesh in first yod.
The text quality is good. The first yod is fatter in its lower portion than the second yod. Although a slight, blurred protrusion occurs in the first yod in a position appropriate for a dagesh, the overall addition is a blob of ink, not a dagesh.
BHL has no dagesh in the first yod. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Examine first letter in word.
This is likely to be poor penmanship. The author suggests that the scribe mis-drew the second letter as a kaf and crudely corrected it to a bet, resulting in a gimel-like leg at the base of the vav. Note that the top of the vav is smeared onto the top of the bet. A gimel is extremely unlikely here.
BHL has an initial vav with a dagesh (acting as a shureq) and meteg followed by a bet with a sheva. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Add dagesh to he.
A dark, well-positioned dagesh appears in the he. The text is in good condition here.
BHL has no dagesh in the he. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Examine vowel below the lamed.
The lower dot of the putative segol below the lamed is reddish, but dark and well-positioned.
BHL has a tsere below the lamed. BHLA has a segol below the lamed.
Examine fourth letter, a probable vav. Add note 't'.
The fourth letter has only its top in ink. A clear shadow of a vav is present, however. This might be an erasure or might be an unintentional loss of ink, e.g., flaking off. The transcription assumes the loss of ink on the vav was unintentional and keeps the vav. This is assumption agrees with Dotan's BHL. A transcription note 't' is added to reflect the uncertainty of the decision, however.
BHL has a vav as the fourth letter. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Examine vowel below the resh and for possible splitting of word after the yod. Add note 't'.
The text is of good quality. Three dots appear in a horizontal line under the resh; the first two are in contact. This is probably poor penmanship. No maqaf is apparent between the yod and the kaf. Word gaps are hard to judge and no gap is obvious between the yod and the kaf. Splitting the word at the yod without a maqaf leaves the first part of the word without an accent, however. Adding note 't'.
BHL has a tsere below the resh; it has a maqaf after the yod, starting a new word, כן. BHLA has a tsere below the resh; it has a space after the yod, starting a new word, כן.
Examine vowel below the he.
Chipping of the ink has occurred in this word. The lower dot of the vowel beneath the he is light, but well-sized and well-positioned. The other dots of the segol show signs of ink chipping.
BHL has a segol below the he. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Examine sheva below vav. Add dagesh to vav. Add note 't'.
The upper dot of the putative sheva under the vav is very weak, but well-positioned. A very clear dagesh is present in the vav, however.
BHL has a sheva below the vav. BHLA has a sheva below the vav; however, it has a dagesh in the vav.
Examine first letter. Change vowel under the pe to patah. Add note 't'.
The text is in poor condition, with much chipping of ink. (The image shows the final yod of the previous word.) The outline of a chipped yod at the start of this word is evident. The vowel below the pe could be a patah, a segol, or qamats. The shape of the upper portion of the vowel is more like a broken bar than two dots; this would make the vowel either a patah or qamats. The lower portion of the vowel appears to be an erasure, rather than chipping, as the shape of the area is too large to be a chipped dot. The vowel will be transcribed as a patah and a note 't' added.
BHL has an initial yod and a segol under the pe. BHLA has an initial yod and a qamats under the pe.
Remove dagesh from shin.
No dagesh is evident in the shin.

Change meteg to merkha under the first he.
The thin line after the qamats on the first he has the required northeast-to-southwest inclination of a merkha.
BHL has a merkha after the qamats under the first he. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
* Remove dagesh from shin. Add note 't'

Remove maqaf from end of word.
No maqaf is apparent at the end of this word.
BHL has a maqaf at the end of this word. BHLA has no maqaf at the end of this word.
Remove meteg under the mem. Add note 't'.
An erasure appears between the patah under the mem and the sheva under the he. A small lower dot of a possible meteg remains in the region. The current form of the text is transcribed without the meteg and a note 't' added.
BHL has no meteg under the mem. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Change merkha to munah under the bet.
The sharp bend in the accent is distinct, making it a munah. The line emerging from the top leading arm of the alef is from a tipeha on the preceding word 8 of this verse.
BHL has a munah under the bet. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
* Change zaqef-qatan over the mem to revia. Add note 't'.
An erasure appears above the trailing edge of the mem. In the erasure is a fractured dot that might be considered part of a zaqef-qatan; however, this dot is offset too far to the left for it to be part of a zaqef-qatan. It will be transcribed as a revia.
BHL has a zaqef-qatan over the mem. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Move tipeha from under pe to under het.
The tipeha is clearly under the het.

Change accent from munah to tipeha under the resh.
The accent under the resh is clearly a tipeha and not a munah.
BHL has a tipeha under the resh. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
* Examine the very ambiguous markings under the yod and resh. Add note 't'.
The text is of poor quality with lots of chipped ink in this region. Credible shevas appear under both the lamed and the resh. A very chipped potential qamats then meteg pair might be assumed under the yod. A light, smeared horizontal bar appears under the resh. It is too high to be transcribed as a patah. The current text's qamats then meteg will be retained. A transcription note 't' is added.
BHL has a qamats then meteg under the yod. It has a sheva under both the lamed and the resh. That is, the BHL does not consider the horizontal bar under the resh to be part of the text. BHLA has a qamats, meteg under the yod and a hataf-patah under the resh. That is, BHLA considers the horizontal bar under the resh to be part of the text.

No dagesh is apparent in the first yod.
BHL has a dagesh in the first yod. BHLA has no entry for this verse.

BHL has a dagesh in the first yod. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Move munah from first to second vav.
The munah is under the second vav, probably because of the tail in the ayin. With care, the munah could have been placed under the first vav and ayin tail.
BHL has a munah under the first vav. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Examine possible dagesh in final vav. Add note 't'.
The text is in good condition near this word. A reddish dot appears in the correct vertical position in the final vav. The dot is faint and is positioned too far to the left.
BHL has no dagesh in the final vav. BHLA has no entry for this verse.

Change pashta on final kaf to qadma.
The mark above the final kaf is not sufficiently to the left (postfix) to be transcribed as a pashta.
BHL has a clear qadma over the final kaf. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Change sheva under first kaf to hataf-patah.
Under the first kaf the sheva is followed by a bar. This bar is slightly lighter, but appears to be deliberate and unerased. Hence the vowel will be transcribed as a hataf-patah.
BHL has a hataf-patah under the first kaf. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Change meteg under bet to merkha. Remove maqaf from end of word.
The image shows both this word, word 5, and its successor. The vertical accent under the bet has a very slight tail to the left. It also has a very slight northeast-to-southwest inclination. Thus it will be transcribed as a merkha. No maqaf appears at the end of this word, word 5.
BHL has a merkha under the bet and no maqaf at the end of this word. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Remove dagesh from qof.
A slight bulge appears at the top of the vertical stem of the qof. It is too slight to be transcribed as a dagesh.
BHL has a dagesh in the qof. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
* Add meteg between sheva and patah under the alef. Add ZWJ to force visual ordering to match LC. Add note 't'.
A slightly curved mark occurs between the sheva and the patah. The comma-like shape of the meteg is a very unusual. The markings below the alef probably mean a hataf-patah vowel with a meteg accent. Other instances of a meteg 'splitting' a hataf vowel occur in the LC.
BHL has sheva, then meteg, then patah under the alef. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Remove munah under zayin. Add accent segol to het.
The image includes the following word, הבקר, as part of the discussion below. No munah appears under the zayin. The accent segol on the het is clear. The revia over the following word is also evident.
BHL has no munah under the zayin; it has an accent segol on the het. On the next word BHL has a revia over the qof. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
A potentially "consensus" pointing for this word pair is munah then segol with the munah under the zayin of the first word and a segol over the resh of the second word. Of interest are the erasure splotches in the image under the zayin of the first word and over the resh of the second word. This suggests a delibrate correction of the LC by a scribe contrary to the "consensus" pointing. BHL, as expected, reflects the actual LC pointing of both words. BHS has a munah then revia pointing of the two words; agreeing with the "consensus" on the first word and the LC on the second. The pre-change UXLC pointing of the first word with a munah under the zayin and a revia over the resh probably reflects the pointing of the BHS from which the WLC was transcribed.
Replace mahapakh under resh with darga.
The darga shape is distinctive.
BHL has a darga under the resh. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
* Accents under the bet and alef are uncertain. Add note 't'.
Both the bet and alef have vertical bars under them. The bar under the alef is significantly longer. Generally, this would indicate that the bar under the alef is a merkha as in the present text. (This is in contrast to BHL which has a meteg under the alef.)
BHL has a merkha under the bet and a meteg under the alef. BHLA has no entry for this verse.

BHL has a tipeha under the nun. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Change tipeha to merkha under the pe.
The near-vertical line under the pe has a slight curvature to the left at its lower end; hence a merkha will be transcribed. This is the second of three consecutive words being changed. Taken together, they change the accent pattern on the words from merkha-tipeha-merkha to tipeha-merkha-meteg.
BHL has a tipeha under the pe. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Change merkha to meteg under mem.
The near-vertical lacks the northeast-to-southwest inclination of a merkha; it is transcribed as a meteg. This is the third of three consecutive words being changed. Taken together, they change the accent pattern on the words from merkha-tipeha-merkha to tipeha-merkha-meteg.
BHL has a meteg under the mem. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Examine etnachta position under second bet.

BHL has a hiriq then munah under the resh. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Change tevir under kaf to merkha.
The near-vertical bar under the kaf has a very slight northeast-to-southwest inclination and is longer than a typical meteg. The interior of the lamed has an erasure that touches small portions of the lamed and yod.

A pashta is evident above the yod.
BHL has a pashta above the yod. BHLA has no entry for this verse.

BHL has the meteg below the qof. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Remove qadma over tav; add pashta to he.
The accent is clearly above the he; it is distinctly postfix and is therefore a pashta.
BHL has a qadma over the tav. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Change patah under first he to hataf-patah.
The sheva component of the hataf-patah is clear.
BHL has a patah under the first he. BHLA has no entry for this verse.

The tevir is evident.
BHL has a tevir under the pe. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Add telisha-qetana over resh.
The telisha-qetana over the resh is evident. A slightly lighter and higher circle appears over the mem-ayin pair. This is a masorah circle and isn't transcribed here.
BHL has a telisha-qetana only over the he. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Change darga to meteg under the resh.
The accent under the mark is not squiggly like a darga. It might be a merkha, but it has no northeast-to-southwest inclination and is short. It will be transcribed as a meteg.
BHL has a darga under the resh. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Change zaqef-qatan to revia over he.
A smudge appears above the clear dot above the he. The smudge is very diffuse and too far to the right to be associated with the dot as a part of a zaqef-qatan.
BHL has a revia over the he. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Remove dagesh from tsadi. Add note 't'.
The word נבוכדנאצר normally has a dagesh in the tsadi. The dagesh is usually placed below the upper arms of the tsadi as displayed in the modern font. Here the tsadi has a reddish blob in between its upper arms. The blob is larger than expected and positioned too far to the left. A dagesh will not be transcribed in the tsadi; however, a note 't' will be added.
BHL has a dagesh in the tsadi. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Remove dagesh from shin.
No dagesh is apparent in the shin.

Add meteg under vav.
The text is of good quality and clearly shows a meteg under the vav.
BHL has a meteg under the vav. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Remove first pashta from tav.
The mark over the bet might be taken as either a holam or pashta; it can't be both. The connection between the black (presumably holam) dot and the bet is faint, making a pashta unlikely. No pashta is over the tav. It will be removed.
BHL has a holam on the bet and a first pashta over the tav. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Examine trace vertical line under the dalet.
A faint vertical line appears under the dalet. It is much lighter than any other parts of this word and appears to be an erasure. The 6-th word of following verse, Deut 17:10.6, יגידו, has a clear meteg under the dalet. The scribe may have mistaken which word he was accenting, written a meteg on this word, discovered his error, and erased the erroneous meteg.
BHL has no meteg under the dalet; Deut 17:10.6 has a meteg under the dalet. BHLA has no entry for this verse or for Deut 17:10.
Remove sheva from under first nun. Add note 'c'.
The image is the LC body text which consists of the ketiv consonants, מבן־ימין (2 words), with the qere pointing. The qere consonants, מבנימין, appear to the right of the column. Words 3, 4, 5 of the UXLC represent both the LC body text and the qere consonants; words 3, 4 contain the ketiv variants for this image; UXLC word 5 is the qere variant, shown in the Reference/Change above. No sheva is present under the first nun in the image, probably because of the long tail of the ketiv final nun; hence, the qere has no sheva under the nun. The usual spelling of Benjamin, בִנְיָמִן, is with a sheva under the first nun. A transcription note 'c' will be added.
BHL has a sheva under the first nun in the qere. BHLA has no sheva under the first nun in the qere; it also agrees with the UXLC ketiv.
Examine weak maqaf following the final nun, the second consonant, in the LC word. Add note 't'.
The image is the LC body text which consists of the ketiv consonants, מן המערה (2 words), with the qere pointing. The qere consonants, מהמערה, appear to the left of the column. Words 6, 7, 8 of the UXLC represent both the LC body text and the qere consonants; words 6, 7 contain the ketiv variants for this image; UXLC word 6 is the first ketiv variant, shown in the Reference above. This change is to the UXLC word 6, מן־, the first ketiv word. The maqaf between the final nun following the first mem is very faint in the image. A note 't' will be added following the maqaf in ketiv word 6.
BHL agrees with the UXLC text in both the qere and ketiv variants. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Remove meteg under he. Add note 't'.
The image is the LC body text which consists of the ketiv consonants, הוא־והיא (2 words), with the qere pointing. The first qere consonants, היא appear the right of the column, the second qere consonants, והוא , appear to the left of the column. Words 6, 7, 8, 9 of the UXLC represent both the LC body text and the qere consonants; words 6, 7 contain the ketiv variants for this image; UXLC word 8 is the first qere word, shown in the Reference/Change above. This change is to the UXLC word 8, a qere word. No meteg is apparent under the he, only a hiriq. The evidence for a maqaf between the alef and the second vav is weak. A note 't' will be added to this first qere word; this note about the maqaf also applies to the UXLC ketiv word 6.
BHL agrees with this change in both the qere and ketiv. BHLA has no entry for this verse.
Remove maqaf from ketiv word.
The image is the LC body text which consists of the ketiv consonants, מן־בת־ (2 words), with the qere pointing. The qere consonants, מבת, appear to the left of the column. Words 2, 3, 4 of the UXLC represent both the LC body text and the qere consonants; words 3, 4 contain the ketiv variants for this image; UXLC word 2 is the first ketiv variant, shown in the Reference/Change above. No maqaf is present between the final nun and the following bet in the image. This change removes the maqaf from the UXLC ketiv word in position 2, מן־ .
BHL agrees with this change in both the qere and ketiv. BHLA has no entry for this verse.

Remove maqaf from qere word.
This word is the first qere component of a two word qere, עַל־כֵּ֥ן. The two qere words are part of qere-without-ketiv variant, where the second qere word, כֵּ֥ן, has no matching ketiv word. The tsere, merkha pointings under the lamed belong to the second qere whose letters, כן, are shown in the left margin along with the Masoretic note: qere and no ketiv.
