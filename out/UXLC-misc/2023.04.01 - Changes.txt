Consider replacing qadma with pashta.
Pashtas are postfix accents; if a word has a single pashta it must be written at the end of the word. If a word has two pashtas at one of them must occur on the last consonant of the word; the non-postfix pashta is sometimes called an accent helper pashta. A pashta is normally written on the left side of its consonant; however, with hand written text this positioning on the consonant is NOT determinant. A qadma is normally written over the center of the consonant. Positioning of a pashta or qadma is difficult only when the accent occurs on the last letter. Since the accent in question does not appear on the last letter and the last consonant does not have a pashta this accent is a qadma.

Possible erased yod between tsadi and resh.
The quality of the text in this region is poor. Although sufficient space exists between the tsadi and the resh for a yod, the evidence is insufficient to insert a yod.

BHL has a zaqef-qatan on the alef. BHL Appendix A has a revia on the alef and a '?' note.
Examine for possible dagesh belonging to the first vav.

Change qadma on resh to pashta on yod. Add note 't'.
The accent starts at the top of the yod, rather than the sloping later part of the yod. Distinguishing between a qadma or pashta is difficult on such a thin letter. Pashtas occur more frequently on the final letter of a word than qadmas. Ben Denckla offers a cantillation rule: "When a qadma/pashta appears on a letter that closes a syllable and ends a word ... it should be interpreted as a pashta". Given the uncertainty and need to transcribe the accent, the accent is transcribed here as a pashta with a 't' added.
BHL has a qadma/pashta on the yod, not the resh. The difference between these two accents is hard to determine on such a thin consonant, even on a printed page. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Remove dagesh on bet.
BHL has a dagesh on the bet. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Examine whether first consonant is bet or kaf. Add note 't'.

Severely damaged text. Add note 't'.
This word and the following 3 words are severely damaged, effectively unreadable. The 4 damaged words are the first 4 words on line 18 of the LC. The limitation of the damage to these 4 words is suspicious. Ben Denckla: The under marks are quite clear, however.
The UXLC text agrees with the BHL although the BHL doesn't indicate any problem with the LC text. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Severely damaged text. Add note 't'.
This word, the preceding word, and the following 2 words are severely damaged, effectively unreadable. The 4 damaged words are the first 4 words on line 18 of the LC. The limitation of the damage to these 4 words is suspicious. Ben Denckla: The under marks are quite clear, however.
The UXLC text agrees with the BHL although the BHL doesn't indicate any problem with the LC text. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Severely damaged text. Add note 't'.
This word, the 2 preceding words, and the following word are severely damaged, effectively unreadable. The 4 damaged words are the first 4 words on line 18 of the LC. The limitation of the damage to these 4 words is suspicious. Ben Denckla: The under marks are quite clear, however.
The UXLC text agrees with the BHL although the BHL doesn't indicate any problem with the LC text. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Severely damaged text. Add note 't'.
This word and the 3 preceding words are severely damaged, effectively unreadable. The 4 damaged words are the first 4 words on line 18 of the LC. The limitation of the damage to these 4 words is suspicious. Ben Denckla: The under marks are quite clear, however.
The UXLC text agrees with the BHL although the BHL doesn't indicate any problem with the LC text. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.

The UXLC text agrees with the BHL although the BHL doesn't indicate any problem with the LC text. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Examine zaqef qatan over the bet.
The text is severely damaged in this area. A zaqef qatan is a reasonable choice for the accent over the bet.
The UXLC text agrees with the BHL although the BHL doesn't indicate any problem with the LC text. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Change merkha under kaf to tevir. Add 'c' note.
The dot on the tevir is well-sized, well-positioned, and dark; however, it is slightly brownish.
The BHL has a tevir under the kaf. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Because the preceding word, לָכֶ֛ם, has a tevir accent, this change produces two consecutive words with tevir accents. Although these markings occur in BHL without comment, they're unexpected according to current cantillation rules. Hence, a 'c' note is added.
Remove dagesh from nun.
The BHL has no dagesh in the nun. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Move zaqef qatan from over the nun to over the yod.
The lower dot of the zaqef qatan contacts the top of the yod.
The BHL and UXLC have different versification of Jeremiah chapters 30 and 31. In the BHL chapter 30 has 25 verses; the UXLC has 24 verses. BHL verse 30:25 is UXLC verse 31:1; hence this UXLC verse, 31.4, is BHL verse 31.3. The BHL has a zaqef qatan on the nun. BHL Appendix A has the zaqef qatan on the yod.
Change tipeha under alef to munah.
This is BHL Jeremiah 31:31. The BHL has a munah under the alef. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.

The BHL has a maqaf at the end of this word. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Change yetiv on lamed to mahapakh.
A yetiv is prepositive, that is, a yetiv appears on the leading edge of a consonant. This accent is not prepositive and is therefore a mahapakh.
The BHL has a mahapakh on the lamed. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Add revia above the yod.
A previous change in Changes file 2021.10.19 - Changes, change 2021.08.07 - 7, had an incorrect image for this word. The image was of word 10. The error has been corrected in the Changes file 2021.10.19 - Changes on 15 Jan 2023.
This word, 13, has a revia above the yod. The transcription note 'c' from the previous change, which was based on an incorrect image, will be removed.
The BHL has a revia above the yod. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Consider merging this word with following word. Add note 't'.
No maqaf occurs at the end of this word, ונשארו. The spacing between the final vav of this word and the bet of the next word, בם, is very small. The UXLC interprets words 9, 10 as two distinct words and adds a 't' note.
The BHL has qadma on the nun and a maqaf at the end of this word. The following BHL word, בם, has a zaqef qatan over the bet which would indicate the BHL poetic word (words 9, 10) has two accents; together, these two accents would represent a metigah-zaqef accent. A metigah exists only as part of a two-accent-on-a-poetic-word combination called a metigah-zaqef. The zaqef in a metigah-zaqef is always a zaqef qatan. BHL Appendix A has words (9, 10) without a space or a maqaf and a '?' mark; together, these two accents would represent a metigah-zaqef accent on the compound word.

The BHL has no dagesh in the qof, it has a dagesh in the lamed, however. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Remove qadma from above ayin.
The images shows two maqaf-connected words: ועל דמך. This change applies to the first word of these words, ועל. The following word, דמך, has a zaqef qatan on the mem.
Ben Denckla: The Unicode qadma removed here would have functioned as an accent called a "metigah". A metigah exists only as part of a two-accent-on-a-poetic-word combination called a metigah-zaqef. The zaqef in a metigah-zaqef is always a zaqef qatan. This change removes a metigah-zaqef from these two words; the poetic word formed from these two maqaf-connected words continues to have an accent, a zaqef qatan.

The pashta/qadma accent is clearly on the yod. Pashtas occur more frequently on the final letter of a word than qadmas. Ben Denckla offers a cantillation rule: "When a qadma/pashta appears on a letter that closes a syllable and ends a word ... it should be interpreted as a pashta". Given the uncertainty and need to transcribe the accent, the accent is transcribed here as a pashta with a 't' added.
The BHL has a pashta/qadma over the nun; it's hard to tell the difference even in this modern, printed document. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Change qamats under vav to patah.
BHL has a patah under the vav. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Note possible meteg on bet. Add note 't'.
At question is the dark vertical line on the leading edge of the bet. It is not expected that a meteg would be written in this position. It is too low to be a paseq.
BHL agrees with the reference UXLC text. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Remove vav, placing holam on kaf.
BHL has no vav between the kaf and the lamed. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Remove dagesh from samekh.
The samekh contains a nearly-vertical, dark line on its inner left edge. It is not dot-like and unlikely to be a dagesh.

The lowest of the three dots of the reference segol is well-positioned, but lighter and smaller than the upper two dots.
BHL has a tsere under the vav. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Add merkha to kaf.
BHL has a tipeha under the kaf. BHL Appendix A has a merkha under the kaf.
Remove qadma on the resh, add pashta to yod.
The accent on the yod in the image is clearly postpositive and, therefore, a pashta.

Move qadma over nun to he.
The qadma being moved is part of a metigah-zaqef accent pair.
BHL has a qadma over the he. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Move tipeha under tav to under resh. Add note 't'.
Normally, accents are written after a vowel. The tipeha in the image could be considered under either the resh or the tav. Space is available after the segol to write the tipeha had the scribe intended to do so.
BHL has the tipeha under the tav positioned after the segol. BHL Appendix A has the tipeha under the tav but positioned before the segol.
Remove maqaf from end of word.
The image shows 3 words: עד בלי די, words 27, 28, 29 of Mal 3:10. This change is on word 27, עד. In conjunction with the subsequent change to Mal 3:10.28, this change produces three space-separated words, rather than three maqaf-separated words.
BHL has a maqaf at the end of this word; that is, words 27, 28, 29 are separated by maqafs. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Remove maqaf from end of word.
The image shows 3 words: עד בלי די, words 27, 28, 29 of Mal 3:10. This change is on word 28, בלי. In conjunction with the previous change to Mal 3:10.27, this change produces three space-separated words, rather than three maqaf-separated words.
BHL has a maqaf at the end of this word; that is, words 27, 28, 29 are separated by maqafs. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Replace mahapakh on kaf with yetiv.
A yetiv is prepositive, a mahapakh is centered on the consonant.
BHL has a yetiv on the kaf. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Add dagesh to lamed.
BHL has no dagesh in the lamed. BHL Appendix A has a dagesh in the lamed.

Remove dagesh from dalet.
The dalet has a rafe above it confirming that no dagesh is present in the dalet.
BHL has a dagesh in the dalet. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Remove pashta from final mem. Add note 't'.
This change does not refer to the dark, clearly-defined tipeha above the right edge of the final mem; the tipeha belongs to the word on the previous line, Deut 5:12.7. An ill-defined diagonal stub occurs on the upper, left top of the final mem. It has a possible other remnant to the left of the sheva on the previous line. It could be a remnant of an erased pashta.
UXLC verse Deut 5:13 corresponds to BHL verse Deut 5:12. BHL has a pashta on the final mem. BHL Appendix A has no pashta on the final mem.
Change dehi on tet to tipeha (= tarḥa).
The mark in the LC is not sufficiently prepositive (advanced relative to the consonant) to be transcribed as a dehi.
BHL has a tipeha (=tarḥa) on the tet. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Move revia back from second vav to nun.
BHL has the revia over the nun. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Move mahapakh from dalet to vav. Add note 't'.
The mahapakh most likely belongs to the dalet rather than the vav. The lack of space under the dalet likely caused the shift from the dalet to vav. The mahapakh will be transcribed under the vav to represent the text image. Although the changed text places the mahapakh under the vav, fonts may place the mahapakh slightly to the left of the vav. This is the case with the Taamey D Web font here.
BHL has the mahapakh on the dalet. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Note uncertain mark on pe. Add note 't'.
Accent below the pe should be a meteg serving as a siluq as all verses must end in a siluq.
At issue is the dot to the left of the vertical bar under the pe. The dot is well-sized and well-positioned relative to the vertical bar; the color of the dot is brownish, however. If this dot was written by the scribe, the accent would be a tevir as in the current UXLC text. The LC is in very good condition on this page and has very few scattered dots of this size and color. The UXLC continues to represent the LC image and adds a 't' note.
BHL has a meteg serving as a siluq under the pe. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Remove iluy from bet.
An iluy has two sides and is more rectangular than the image's half circle above the bet. It is almost certainly a broken masorah circle referring to the masoretic note in the left text margin. The note, according to Ben Denckla, says “4× haser in the Neviʾim.” .
BHL has a no iluy on the bet. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Remove meteg from tav.
The image shows very little evidence of a meteg on the tav.
BHL has no meteg on the tav. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Replace patah under ayin with sheva. Add note 't'.
The text quality is poor. Neither a patah or sheva marking is clear; though a sheva is more evident. The size of this sheva is significantly smaller than that on the following tsadi.
BHL has a sheva under the ayin. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Replace sheva under qof with hataf-patah. Add 'c' note.
The patah component of the hataf-patah under the qof is vertically offset from its normal position and slightly brownish. Many texts have only a sheva on the qof; thus a 'c' note will be added.
BHL has a hataf-patah under the qof. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Breuer-DM notes that the LC has a hataf-patah under the qof.
Add paseq to end of word.
BHL has a paseq mark ( ׀ ) at the end of this word. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Add meteg under initial alef.
The meteg leads the head of the lamed of the following line and is distinct.
BHL has a meteg following the qamats under the alef. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Change mahapakh on kaf to yetiv.
The mahapakh/yetiv mark is displaced to the right of the consonant and therefore a yetiv.

Move darga from under gimel to under dalet.
BHL has the darga under the dalet. BHL Appendix A makes no comment on this verse.
Interchange qere/ketiv order (Part 1 of 2).
The normal order qere/ketiv pairs in the UXLC is ketiv-then-qere. The order of this pair, qere-then ketiv, was incorrectly entered in change 2021.02.22 - 28 of Changes file 2021.04.01 - Changes. This change swaps the order of the two variants by merging them in change 2023.03.06 - 1 (this change) and then splitting them in change 2023.03.06 - 2 (the next change).
The combined actions of these 2 changes have the side effect of adding 2 consonant changes to the consonant changes in the Supplements/Differences result in UXLC 1.7 - UXLC 1.8.xml.
