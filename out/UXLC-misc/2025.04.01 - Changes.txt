Patah under the he is a segol in many texts. Add note'c' after he.
The patah under the he is very clear; but wider and lighter than other marks on this page. BHL, MAM and other texts have a segol rather than a patah under the he. Add a note 'c' to indicate a peculiarity of the LC.
BHL has a segol under the he. BHLA has a patah under the he with the note "(s. m.)", secunda manus, second hand.
