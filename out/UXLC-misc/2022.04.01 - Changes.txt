Unusual order of accents on nun; add note 'c'.
Here the LC has a revia followed by a geresh-shaped mark. This is probably an unusual presentation of the two-mark accent revia mugrash. The usual encoding of a revia mugrash (241 instances) is a geresh muqdam (x059d), a prepositive mark, followed by revia (x0597).
The UXLC encodes this single-incidence text as a revia followed by (plain) geresh (x059c). (An alternative encoding would be a revia followed by a geresh muqdam; however, this would place a prepositive mark after the revia.)
Replace holam with revia, add note 't'.
The LC has a dot above the nun. The transcription problem is to determine whether the dot is a holam or a revia. If the dot represents a holam, then the word is without an accent; if it represents a revia it lacks an expected vowel.
Seth (Avi) Kadish points out: "Many masoretic manuscripts leave out the ḥolam dot in the divine name as a rule, and some do so even when it is spelled אדני. While the LC itself normally has the ḥolam dot in the spelling אדני, here it does not. This should be considered an anomaly rather than an error, and the dot that appears directly over the letter נ should be understood as a revia` rather than ḥolam. It is even possible that the single dot is intended to serve both purposes."
Change qadma to a revia.
Add sheva to second lamed, remove dagesh from vav, add note 'c'.
The LC clearly has a sheva on the second lamed and lacks a dagesh on the vav.
The normal spelling would have no sheva on the second lamed and would have a dagesh on the vav. The LC is anomalous and the UXLC replicates it correctly.
A hint of a maqaf might be seen between the vav and the yod. The immediately preceding word in Ps 105:45.6 shows a very distinct maqaf, however.
Move patach to ayin, add note 't'.
In the LC, the patach appears to belong to the yod, not the ayin. The Miqra According to the Masorah (MAM) assigns the patach to the ayin, which is what would be expected grammatically: a furtive patach on ayin. The UXLC transcription does the same as MAM: it assigns the patach to the ayin. That is, the UXLC transcription assumes that the scribe's placement of this patach is just an extreme example of the normal "early" (right-biased) placement of a furtive patach.
Move patach to ayin.
In the LC the patach is located between the yod and the ayin. It's probably a furtive patach, and thus should be coded as belonging to the ayin not the yod. (It is normal for the scribe to give a furtive patach an "early" (right-biased) placement.)
Add maqaf, change tipeha to meteg, add note 't'.
The maqaf is clear in the LC.
The accent under the qamats of the final kaf could be either a tipeha, a primary accent, or a meteg, a secondary accent. A tipeha is a diagonal line from northwest to southeast, a meteg is a vertical line. When a maqaf is added to this word it becomes a poetic word with the following word, Ps 31:2.2. Poetic words normally contain a single primary accent. Word Ps 31:2.2 has a clear primary munah accent, thus the accent in question is likely to be a meteg, a secondary accent.
Dotan (Biblia Hebraica Leningradensia, 2001) has a meteg for the accent in question.

Unexpected hataf qamats on initial he, missing dagesh on shin; add note 'c'.
